## Features

1) Working implementation + dynamic visualization
- Core engine implements all paper semantics; 132 tests pass (including hypothesis tests to catch randomized edge cases)
- UI provides live execution, state coloring, import/export, and auto‚Äëlayout

2) Demonstrate ReCoN solving a representation problem
- ARCON reframes ‚Äúwhich object to click‚Äù as a ReCoN hypothesis: perceive ‚Üí select ‚Üí verify; with `exploration_rate=0`, decisions come from the ReCoN script
- ReCoN ARC Angel uses a CNN terminal to drive `sub/sur` link weights in a hierarchical hypothesis (with `por/ret` sequencing for ACTION6), yielding mask‚Äëaware coordinate selection and background suppression

3) Bonus components
- Hybrid nodes (explicit/implicit/neural), PyTorch neural terminals, continuous message protocol, multi‚Äëformat exporters, ARC mappings, production UI

## Scope

The scope of this repository is deliberately constrained to deliver a high‚Äësignal implementation and visualization of a Request Confirmation Network (ReCoN), plus a concrete representation demo on ARC‚Äëlike tasks. We explicitly prioritize:

- Correctness of the 8‚Äëstate semantics and Table 1 message passing
- Dynamic, inspectable visualization of execution over completeness of editor features
- A grounded representation demo (ARC) over broad task coverage
- Visualization of previously run ARC AGI 3 challenges on 2 separate ReCoN networks

Out of scope for this iteration:

- Full MicroPsi2 parity or feature completeness
- Large‚Äëscale model training; terminals use compact CNNs or stubs adequate for demonstrations
- Production multi‚Äëuser backend; API is single‚Äëprocess and file‚Äëbacked for simplicity
- Real time ARC AGI 3 visualization synchronized with the ReCoN agents message propagation

These boundaries keep iteration fast and evaluation clear, matching the challenge‚Äôs emphasis on translating a novel representation into a working system and UI.

## Approach

The build process follows a research‚Äëengineer workflow:

- Stage‚Äë2 mini‚Äëprojects cadence: implement in 1‚Äì2 day slices with tight feedback loops (write ‚Üí run ‚Üí visualize ‚Üí refine)
- Exploration ‚Üí Understanding loop: instrument the engine to falsify hypotheses about state transitions, inhibition, and confirmation propagation; add visual probes first
- Pragmatic LLM use: generate drafts for boilerplate and schema wiring; hand‚Äëverify core semantics and tests
- Post‚Äëmortems per slice: capture mistakes and fixes directly in tests (e.g., por/ret timing, terminal constraints)

Design choices derived from the paper and platform goals:

- Dual node styles: explicit 8‚Äëstate nodes and compact/continuous integration for neural terminals and activation‚Äëweighted flows
- Strict link constraints and por/ret sequence inhibition to preserve script faithfulness
- Exporters that bridge engine ‚Üî UI to keep instrumentation and debugging frictionless

### MVP implementation approach

- Core engine from scratch: Build a paper‚Äëfaithful backend rather than forking legacy code. Implement `ReCoNNode` with the 8 states (inactive, requested, active, waiting, suppressed, true, confirmed, failed) and typed gates/links (`sub/sur` hierarchy, `por/ret` sequence). Implement `ReCoNGraph` for propagation and history. Validate on toy graphs that `por` enforces order and terminals are only targeted by `sub`. If propagation proves unstable, temporarily pivot to discrete‚Äëonly nodes before re‚Äëintroducing tensors.
- Subsymbolic integration + ARC demo: Add PyTorch hooks in terminal nodes. Use compact CNN/autoencoder stubs for features on 64√ó64 ARC‚Äëlike grids. Map [BlindSquirrel](https://github.com/wd13ca/ARC-AGI-3-Agents)/ARCON structures into ReCoN: rules become `por/ret` chains, valid‚Äëaction checks become terminals, and value models plug into terminals. Create import/export helpers (JSON ‚Üî engine) so the same graphs drive both engine tests and the UI.
- Backend API for user‚Äëcreated networks: Expose minimal endpoints to create nodes/links, request roots, step/execute with history, and import/export JSON. Return snapshots for visualization with states, messages, and step counters. Keep the API intentionally small to reduce complexity and encourage rapid iteration.
- React Flow visual editor: Provide a canvas to add `script/terminal/hybrid` nodes, connect typed links, and trigger execution. Color by state, animate requests/confirmations, and surface link weights. Integrate live snapshots from the API; add a simple import/export panel to round‚Äëtrip engine graphs. Prefer auto‚Äëlayout and instrumented visuals over advanced editor affordances in the MVP.
- Bonuses and polish: Add lightweight learning hooks (e.g., SGD on link weights after failure), and additional exporters (DOT/Graphviz) only if time permits. Produce a short video walkthrough showing build‚Äëedit‚Äëexecute of a small ARC‚Äëlike task. Harden error messages for invalid links and missing nodes.
- Distillation & submission: Write up the approach, include screenshots/GIF, and capture ‚Äúbeliefs we think are true‚Äù backed by tests and logs. Package a reproducible demo path.

### ARC representation approach

- Problem framing: Treat an ARC grid as a scene. A root hypothesis (e.g., ‚Äúframe change causes score increase‚Äù) branches into sub‚Äëhypotheses. The click pathway is a `por` sequence perceive ‚Üí select ‚Üí verify, where object terminals measure quality scores and `sur` brings bottom‚Äëup evidence to parents. Link weights bias bottom‚Äëup confirmations; thresholds control terminal confirmations.
- ARCON mapping: Set `exploration_rate=0` so selection is scripted by ReCoN. Each candidate object has a terminal; `por/ret` paces the selection/verification. This demonstrates how discrete scripts arbitrate actions using terminal measurements and link weights.
- ReCoN ARC Angel mapping: Use a CNN terminal to produce both action logits and 64√ó64 coordinate probabilities. Convert these into `sub` weights to bias bottom‚Äëup confirmation. Respect the ACTION6 order via `por/ret`: `action_click ‚Üí click_cnn ‚Üí click_objects`. Add mask‚Äëaware selection to suppress background coordinates and encourage picks within object masks. Export per‚Äëstep traces to `recon_log/` for inspection.

### Phase‚Äë2 approach: platformization and hybrid orchestration

- Dual computation modes: Support explicit scripts with discrete states alongside compact nodes carrying continuous activations for probability flows. Allow hybrid nodes to switch modes while preserving state/activation where appropriate.
- Flexible message protocol: Carry both discrete messages (confirm/fail/wait) and tensors, with auto‚Äëconversion (thresholding/embedding) where senders and receivers differ. This enables clean integration of CNN/ResNet terminals without sacrificing script clarity.
- Visual debugging first: Color nodes by state for explicit mode; render activation heatmaps for implicit mode; scale edge thickness by message magnitude. Prioritize observability to accelerate the exploration‚Üíunderstanding cycle.
- Model integration ergonomics: Treat terminals as plugins (CNN, ResNet, custom `.pt`), provide a small ‚Äúmodel zoo,‚Äù and enable upload where feasible. Keep training knobs minimal for demos; focus on predictable inference paths.
- Import/export for reuse: Standardize JSON graphs with structure + weights and provide code generation hooks for standalone agents when needed. This makes it easy to share library templates and compare agent variants.
- Mapping prior winners: [BlindSquirrel](https://github.com/wd13ca/ARC-AGI-3-Agents) aligns with explicit scripts + value terminals; [StochasticGoose](https://github.com/DriesSmit/ARC3-solution) aligns with compact/continuous activations and hierarchical sampling over actions and coordinates. The platform accommodates both within one orchestration framework.

### Research‚Äëengineer workflow in practice

- Fast feedback loops: Before any >30‚Äëminute experiment, brainstorm alternatives. Instrument tests and visuals to falsify semantics bugs (e.g., incorrect inhibition, illegal terminal targets). Keep changes small and observable.
- Getting unstuck: Use 5‚Äëminute idea sprints and ‚Äúgain surface area‚Äù techniques‚Äîvary prompts, switch inputs, probe states/activations, or create small synthetic cases. Prefer breadth over premature optimization early on.
- LLM‚Äëassisted coding: Use AI to draft boilerplate or adapters; rewrite and tighten core semantics and tests by hand. If a draft accumulates subtle bugs, restart from a simpler, verified core.
- I used many throwaway networks/architectures and pivoted aggressively to find good working solutions. Towards the end, around 5 in the morning, I was about to delete an entire network but realized that it was solving many ARC levels better than winning solutions. This was a breakthrough moment for me. I tested them across other levels and scenarios with an adversarial/red-teaming approach.

### Risks and mitigations

- Propagation correctness: If activation‚Äëbased propagation yields ambiguous outcomes, fall back to discrete‚Äëonly nodes and reintroduce tensors behind clear thresholds and tests.
- UI complexity: If React Flow customization stalls, bias toward simpler visuals first (state colors, edge labels), and postpone advanced editing affordances.
- Performance: Prefer numpy fallbacks for demos if PyTorch overhead becomes a bottleneck; add top‚ÄëK pruning and caching in click arbitration in future work.
- Scope creep: Keep API/editor minimal; defer multi‚Äëuser and heavy learning to later phases.

### Success metrics

- End‚Äëto‚Äëend: A user can build/edit/execute a small ReCoN for an ARC‚Äëlike task and observe faithful state/message dynamics.
- Representation: ReCoN improves decision quality over a baselines‚Äô naive selection (e.g., via masked coordinates and confirmation‚Äëdriven arbitration).
- Reliability: Semantics are exercised by tests; demos produce readable logs and visual traces suitable for debugging and explanation.

## Why ReCoN

ReCoNs execute hierarchical, sequential scripts distributively via stateful nodes and typed links:
- States: inactive, requested, active, suppressed, waiting, true, confirmed, failed
- Links: sub/sur (hierarchy), por/ret (sequence)
- Terminals confirm based on measurements; confirmations aggregate bottom‚Äëup through `sur`

This implementation matches the paper‚Äôs Table 1 semantics and supports the compact arithmetic rules for neural integration.

## Engine Overview (`recon_engine/`)

- `node.py`: 8‚Äëstate ReCoN node and message processing
- `graph.py`: Network execution, propagation, execution history, and exporters (React Flow, Cytoscape, D3, Graphviz)
- `messages.py`: Discrete/continuous message handling
- `hybrid_node.py`: Hybrid nodes (explicit/implicit/neural) with mode switching
- `neural_terminal.py`: Wrap PyTorch models as terminals (value, probability, classification, embedding)

Key properties
- Exact link constraints (terminals: only target by `sub`, source `sur`)
- por/ret sequence inhibition and timing; sub/sur hierarchy
- Bottom‚Äëup confirmation scaled by link weights and sender activation
- Execution history and export for visualization

## API Overview (`api/`)

The FastAPI service in `api/app.py` exposes endpoints for constructing, executing, and visualizing networks. It is intentionally minimal for single‚Äëuser development and UI integration:

- Create/list/delete networks
- Add nodes and links with typed constraints
- Request roots, step propagation, execute with full history
- Import/export network JSON and serve parsed demo networks

Run locally:

```bash
uvicorn api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001
```

## ARCON Demo (ARC‚ÄëAGI tasks)

Paths:
- Agent: `recon_agents/arcon/agent.py`
- State graph + ReCoN hypothesis: `recon_agents/arcon/state_graph.py`
- Harness adapter: `ARC-AGI-3-Agents/agents/arcon_harness.py`

What‚Äôs demonstrated
- Hypothesis node `score_increase_hypothesis` with two branches: basic actions and click
- Click branch is a 3‚Äëstep script: perceive ‚Üí select (terminals per object) ‚Üí verify
- Object terminals confirm using quality measures; link weights bias bottom‚Äëup confirmation

Recommended demo config
- Set `exploration_rate=0.0` in `arcon_harness.py` to ensure decisions are made by the ReCoN script

## ReCoN ARC Angel Demo (ARC‚ÄëAGI tasks)

Paths:
- Production agent: `recon_agents/recon_arc_angel/improved_production_agent.py`
- Improved hierarchy + sequence and mask‚Äëaware coupling: `recon_agents/recon_arc_angel/improved_hierarchy_manager.py`
- Learning loop (CNN + optional ResNet value): `recon_agents/recon_arc_angel/learning_manager.py`
- Harness adapter: `ARC-AGI-3-Agents/agents/recon_arc_angel.py`

What‚Äôs demonstrated
- CNN terminal (`CNNValidActionTerminal`) produces action and 64√ó64 coordinate probabilities that become `sub` link weights
- Proper ACTION6 sequence: `action_click ‚Üí click_cnn ‚Üí click_objects` with `por/ret`
- Mask‚Äëaware coordinate selection within object masks; background suppression and comprehensive object scoring; stickiness for frame‚Äëchange persistence
- Step‚Äëby‚Äëstep execution traces and link snapshots exported to `recon_log/`

Runner note
- Use the ARC harness with agent `recon_arc_angel` (see adapter above). The agent returns `GameAction` directly.

## Install & Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
```

Status: **132 tests passing** (state machine, message passing, hierarchy, sequence, hybrid integration, exporters)

## How to run both demos via ARC harness

Prereq (uv):

```bash
pip install --user uv  # or: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

From inside `recon-platform/ARC-AGI-3-Agents`:

```bash
# ReCoN ARC Angel (improved production agent)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" && uv run python main.py -a reconarcangel

# ARCON (ReCoN-backed adapter)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" && uv run python main.py -a arconrecon
```

Notes:
- If running as root, use `/root/.local/bin` in PATH as you did.
- For ARCON, set `exploration_rate=0.0` in `ARC-AGI-3-Agents/agents/arcon_harness.py` to force pure ReCoN selection.
- ReCoN execution traces are written to `recon_log/` (per game/level step JSON).

## Visualization UI (`ui/`)

- React Flow network canvas with state coloring and live updates
- Node inspectors (script, terminal, hybrid) and control panel for execution
- Import/export JSON; supports engine exporters out of the box

Build and run

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev   # or: npm run build && npx serve -s dist
```

You can import `demo_export.json` via the UI‚Äôs Import panel to browse the pre‚Äëbuilt graphs.

## Process Notes

- Tests act as executable documentation of semantics and trade‚Äëoffs (see `tests/`)
- UI and engine evolve in lock‚Äëstep: exporters are extended before UI features to ensure consistent ground truth
- Logs in `recon_log/` are used to validate step‚Äëby‚Äëstep execution and feed the UI‚Äôs history view

## Quick Start (Engine)

```python
from recon_engine import ReCoNGraph

graph = ReCoNGraph()
graph.add_node("root", "script")
graph.add_node("sensor", "terminal")
graph.add_link("root", "sensor", "sub")

graph.request_root("root")
result = graph.execute_script("root")
print(result)  # 'confirmed' or 'failed'
```

## Bonus Components

- Hybrid Node Architecture: explicit ‚Üî implicit ‚Üî neural, with state‚Äëpreserving mode switches
- Neural Terminals: ResNet/CNN integration, value/probability/classification/embedding outputs
- Enhanced Message Protocol: auto conversion between discrete messages and tensor activations
- Exporters: React Flow, Cytoscape, D3, Graphviz; JSON serialization with auto‚Äëlayout helpers

## Roadmap

- Integrate learned affordance directly into object terminals in ARCON
- Graph caching and top‚ÄëK object pruning for faster click arbitration
- WebSocket streaming of execution traces to the UI
- Template library and debugging tools (breakpoints, step‚Äëthrough)

## Code Caveats

- Absolute paths in agents/tests: Several agents and tests assume `/workspace/recon-platform` as the project root and write logs to `/workspace/recon-platform/recon_log`. If you run from a different working directory or inside a container with a different app path (e.g., `/app`), adjust paths or set up compatible bind mounts and permissions.
- Working directory assumptions in API: Endpoints serving parsed networks and logs use relative paths like `ui/parsed_networks` and `recon_log`. Run the API from the repo root or ensure the working directory contains these folders; otherwise, configure your process manager to `cd` into the repo before launching.
- CORS configuration: The API enables `allow_credentials=True` and lists explicit origins plus `*`. In production, browsers disallow `*` with credentials. Prefer explicit origins only and remove the wildcard to avoid subtle CORS failures.
- Symlinks in toolchains: The UI relies on standard `node_modules/.bin` symlinks, and the ARC harness uses a `uv`-managed Python with symlinked interpreters. Some packaging environments that strip or fail to preserve symlinks can break dev workflows; use Node/NPM and `uv` as documented.
- OS portability: Paths and scripts assume a Linux environment (e.g., `/root/.local/bin`, `/workspace/...`). On macOS/Windows, use a POSIX shell or WSL, and verify write permissions for `recon_log`.
- Single‚Äëprocess storage: The API stores networks in memory and reads files from disk without authentication or sandboxing. It is not multi‚Äëtenant or hardened; use behind a trusted front end for demos only.
- Log growth: `recon_log/` can grow quickly during ARC runs. Prune periodically or mount it to a volume with sufficient space.
