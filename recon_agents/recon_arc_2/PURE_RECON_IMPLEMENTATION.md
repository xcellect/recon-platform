# Pure ReCoN Implementation for ARC3

## Overview

This directory now contains a **pure ReCoN implementation** of the ARC3 solution that strictly follows the ReCoN (Request Confirmation Networks) paper semantics. All manual state control has been removed in favor of pure message passing.

## Key Principles Implemented

### 1. Single Root Request
- **Only one** `graph.request_root("hypothesis_root")` call in the entire system
- Child nodes are requested automatically via `sub` link message passing
- No manual `request_root()` calls on individual actions

### 2. States Emerge from Message Passing
- Node states follow Table 1 from the ReCoN paper exactly
- States transition due to incoming messages: `inhibit_request`, `inhibit_confirm`, `wait`, `confirm`, `fail`
- No manual state assignments (`node.state = ...`)
- No manual activation control (`self.activation = ...`)

### 3. Natural Inhibition via Por/Ret Links
- **Por links**: Provide natural successor inhibition (sequences, priorities)
- **Ret links**: Provide predecessor inhibition (confirmation control)
- **No artificial gate nodes** - pure ReCoN link semantics

### 4. CNN Priors via Link Weights
- **α_valid** modulates `sub` link weights (request propagation delay)
- **α_value** modulates `sur` link weights (confirmation strength)
- **Por weights** determine priority ordering between alternatives
- No manual gating or Python-side delays

### 5. Cooldown via Gen Loops
- **Gen self-loops** provide persistent states for failed actions
- Failed nodes stay in `FAILED` state naturally via gen loop arithmetic
- No Python timers or cooldown counters

## Files

### Core Implementation
- `hypothesis.py` - Pure ReCoN HypothesisManager (replaces manual control version)
- `hypothesis_violates_recon.py` - Original implementation (kept for reference)

### Tests
- `test_pure_recon_hypothesis.py` - Core ReCoN semantics tests
- `test_cnn_recon_priors.py` - CNN integration via weights tests
- `test_pure_recon_arc3_integration.py` - End-to-end integration tests

### Legacy Tests (Now Fail)
- `test_cooldown_gate_node.py` - Tests artificial gate nodes (removed)
- `test_valid_gate_node.py` - Tests artificial gate nodes (removed)
- `test_arc3_gates.py` - Tests manual state control (now invalid)

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Violated ReCoN Principles)
```python
# 43+ manual request_root() calls
graph.request_root("action_1")
graph.request_root("action_2")
graph.stop_request("action_1")

# Direct state manipulation
node.state = ReCoNState.SUPPRESSED
self.activation = 1.0

# Artificial gate nodes
cooldown_gate = CooldownGateNode("cooldown_gate")
valid_gate = ValidGateNode("valid_gate")

# Python-side timers
self.cooldowns[action_idx] = 3
```

### After (Pure ReCoN)
```python
# Single root request
graph.request_root("hypothesis_root")

# Natural state emergence
# (states change via message passing only)

# Natural inhibition
graph.add_link("action_1", "action_2", "por")  # action_1 inhibits action_2
graph.add_link("action_2", "action_1", "ret")  # action_2 inhibits action_1 confirmation

# CNN priors via weights
graph.add_link("parent", "child", "sub", weight=alpha_valid)
graph.add_link("child", "parent", "sur", weight=alpha_value)

# Persistent states via gen loops
graph.add_link("action", "action", "gen")  # Failed state persists
```

## Message Flow

Following Table 1 from the ReCoN paper:

| State | Por | Ret | Sub | Sur |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| REQUESTED | inhibit_request | inhibit_confirm | - | wait |
| ACTIVE | inhibit_request | inhibit_confirm | request | wait |
| WAITING | inhibit_request | inhibit_confirm | request | wait |
| TRUE | - | inhibit_confirm | - | - |
| CONFIRMED | - | inhibit_confirm | - | confirm |
| FAILED | inhibit_request | inhibit_confirm | - | - |

## CNN Integration

### α_valid (Validity Prior)
- **Purpose**: Control request propagation timing
- **Implementation**: Sub link weights
- **Effect**: Higher α_valid → faster request → earlier activation

### α_value (Value Prior)
- **Purpose**: Control confirmation strength and alternatives ordering
- **Implementation**: Sur link weights + por ordering
- **Effect**: Higher α_value → stronger confirmation + higher priority

### Cooldown (Failure Persistence)
- **Purpose**: Prevent immediate retry of failed actions
- **Implementation**: Gen self-loops maintain FAILED state
- **Effect**: Natural decay through ReCoN arithmetic rules

## Test Coverage

### Core ReCoN Semantics (6 tests)
- Single root request propagation
- Por inhibition without manual control
- States emerge from messages
- Gen loop persistence for failed states
- No manual request management
- Link weights modulate flow

### CNN Integration (6 tests)
- α_valid affects sub link weights
- α_value affects sur link weights
- Cooldown via gen loops (no Python timers)
- Hypothesis manager pure ReCoN integration
- Alternatives ordering via por weights
- No manual activation or state setting

### Integration Tests (4 tests)
- Full ARC3 workflow with pure ReCoN
- Sequence hypothesis with por/ret ordering
- CNN priors pure weight integration
- No Python state management

**Total: 16 tests, all passing**

## Benefits of Pure ReCoN Implementation

1. **Follows Paper Semantics**: Strictly adheres to ReCoN message passing rules
2. **No Manual State Control**: Eliminates 43+ violations of ReCoN principles
3. **Natural Behavior**: Por/ret/gen links provide all needed control
4. **CNN Integration**: Priors modulate flow through weights, not manual gating
5. **Simpler Architecture**: No artificial nodes or Python-side state management
6. **Correct Cooldowns**: Gen loops provide natural persistent failed states

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all pure ReCoN tests
python -m pytest recon_agents/recon_arc_2/tests/test_pure_recon_hypothesis.py \
                  recon_agents/recon_arc_2/tests/test_cnn_recon_priors.py \
                  recon_agents/recon_arc_2/tests/test_pure_recon_arc3_integration.py -v

# Expected: 16 tests, all passing
```

This implementation now represents a true ReCoN-native solution for ARC3 that follows the paper's request-confirmation network semantics without any violations.
