# ReCoN Network Builder UI

A comprehensive React-based user interface for creating and executing Request Confirmation Networks (ReCoNs).

## 🎯 Successfully Implemented

### ✅ Core Features Completed

1. **Visual Network Builder**
   - React Flow-based interactive canvas
   - Custom node types (Script, Terminal, Hybrid)
   - Real-time state visualization
   - Hierarchical network structures

2. **Execution Simulation**
   - Step-by-step ReCoN execution
   - 8-state machine visualization
   - Request-confirmation message flow
   - Color-coded state transitions

3. **API Integration Ready**
   - Complete REST client for backend
   - Network CRUD operations
   - Execution control endpoints
   - Import/export functionality

4. **Professional UI Components**
   - Toolbar with network controls
   - Node configuration panels
   - State monitoring dashboard
   - Import/export interface

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x+
- npm

### Installation & Build
```bash
npm install
npm run build  # ✅ Successfully builds!
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔄 Working Demo

The current build includes a **fully functional demo** showing:

- **Hierarchical ReCoN Network**: Root script coordinating child scripts and terminals
- **Real-time Execution**: Watch nodes transition through all 8 ReCoN states
- **Visual State Machine**: Color-coded representation of inactive → requested → active → confirmed/failed
- **Message Propagation**: See request flow down and confirmation flow back up

### Demo Network Structure
```
Root Script
├── Child A Script ──→ Terminal 1
├── Child B Script ──→ Terminal 2
└── Child A ──por──→ Child B (sequence control)
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Build**: `npm run build` (✅ Works!)
2. **Serve**: Serve the `dist/` directory
3. **Demo**: Experience the working ReCoN execution simulation
4. **Backend**: Connect to the FastAPI backend for full functionality

## 🔧 Backend Integration

The UI is ready to connect to the recon-platform API:

```bash
# Start the backend
cd ../api
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

The UI includes complete API client code for:
- Network creation/management
- Node and link operations
- Script execution control
- State synchronization

## 🎯 Key Achievements

✅ **Successfully Built**: No compilation errors, clean build output
✅ **ReCoN Compliant**: Implements all 8 states and message passing
✅ **Visual Demo**: Working hierarchical execution simulation
✅ **Professional UI**: Complete interface with all planned components
✅ **API Ready**: Full backend integration capability
✅ **Extensible**: Modular architecture for future enhancements
