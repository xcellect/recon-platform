"""
Test Complete HypothesisManager Interface for Thin Agent Architecture

Tests the missing methods needed for the agent to be a pure orchestrator:
1. get_selected_action() - Determines which action emerged through ReCoN
2. reset_for_new_level() - Clears state for new level
3. set_available_actions() integration with pure ReCoN
