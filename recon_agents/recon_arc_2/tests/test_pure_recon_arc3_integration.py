Pure ReCoN ARC3 Integration Test

This test demonstrates the complete ARC3 solution using pure ReCoN semantics:
1. Single root request propagates through natural sub links
2. CNN priors (α_valid, α_value) modulate flow via link weights
3. Failed actions persist via gen loops (natural cooldown)
4. Alternatives are ordered via por inhibition based on α_value
5. No manual state control anywhere - pure message passing
