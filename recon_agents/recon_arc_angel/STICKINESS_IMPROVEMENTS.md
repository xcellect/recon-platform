# 🎯 IMPROVED OBJECT-SCOPED STICKINESS - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented the improved stickiness heuristic that addresses all the identified issues with object-scoped change detection, conservative application, and boundary contrast emphasis.

## 🔧 **ISSUES FIXED**

### **Original Problem**
> "Stickiness uses global pixel diff; any small change anywhere keeps it 'successful.' You need object-conditional color change, and segmentation should emphasize high-contrast objects."

### ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

## 1. **Object-Scoped Change Detection**
- **Problem Fixed**: Global pixel diff detected any change anywhere in frame
- **Solution**: Object-conditional change detection within clicked object's mask
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Store clicked object's mask and frame
  last_click = {
      'coords': (y, x),
      'obj_idx': selected_object_index,
      'mask': full_frame_boolean_mask,
      'frame_tensor': previous_frame_tensor
  }
  
  # Detect changes only within the mask
  changed = (prev[mask] != curr[mask]).sum()
  ratio = changed / mask.sum()
  success = (ratio >= τ_ratio) or (changed >= τ_pixels)
  ```

## 2. **Conservative Stickiness Application**
- **Gating**: Only apply stickiness when `masked_max_cnn_prob >= p_min` (0.15)
- **Capping**: `stickiness_bonus ≤ min(0.5·stickiness_strength, 0.5·masked_max_cnn_prob)`
- **Clearing**: Clear after K=2 stale attempts or when object vanishes/ACTION6 unavailable

## 3. **Boundary Contrast Calculation**
- **High-Contrast Emphasis**: Objects with distinct boundaries get higher scores
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Calculate 1-pixel boundary ring around object
  boundary = dilate(object_mask, 1) ⊖ object_mask
  contrast = mean(boundary_colors != object_color)  # [0,1]
  
  # Integrate into confidence and selection
  confidence = regularity × size_bonus × (1 - border_penalty) × (0.5 + 0.5·contrast)
  selection_score = masked_max_cnn_prob + 0.3·regularity + 0.4·contrast - penalties + stickiness_bonus
  ```

## 4. **Enhanced Object Scoring**
- **Multi-Factor**: CNN probability + regularity + contrast + stickiness - penalties
- **Contrast Bonus**: 0.4 × contrast score emphasizes high-contrast objects
- **Conservative Stickiness**: Only when CNN prob ≥ 0.15, capped appropriately

## 📊 **Parameters Implemented**

### Stickiness Thresholds
- **τ_ratio = 0.02**: 2% pixel change ratio threshold
- **τ_pixels = 3**: Minimum 3 pixels changed
- **K = 2**: Maximum stale attempts before clearing
- **p_min = 0.15**: Minimum CNN probability to maintain stickiness

### Scoring Weights
- **CNN Score**: `masked_max_cnn_prob` (primary factor)
- **Regularity Bonus**: `0.3 × regularity`
- **Contrast Bonus**: `0.4 × contrast` (new)
- **Area Penalty**: `0.5 × area_frac`
- **Border Penalty**: `0.4 × border_penalty`
- **Stickiness Bonus**: `min(0.5·strength, 0.5·cnn_prob)` (capped)

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

**All 10 stickiness tests passing** ✅

### Test Coverage
1. **Object-Scoped Change Detection** (3/3 ✅)
   - Detects changes within clicked object
   - Ignores changes outside clicked object
   - Respects both ratio and pixel thresholds

2. **Boundary Contrast Calculation** (3/3 ✅)
   - High-contrast objects get high scores
   - Contrast calculation produces valid values [0,1]
   - Contrast affects object confidence scoring

3. **Conservative Stickiness Gating** (3/3 ✅)
   - Gated by CNN probability (p_min=0.15)
   - Properly capped bonus values
   - Clears after K=2 stale attempts

4. **Production Agent Integration** (1/1 ✅)
   - Object masks stored and used correctly
   - Stickiness statistics tracked
   - Full workflow integration

## 🔍 **Debug Features Enhanced**

Set `RECON_DEBUG=1` to see detailed logs:

```
🔍 Object-scoped change detection:
  Changed pixels: 25
  Change ratio: 1.000
  Mask pixels: 25
  Success: True (tau_ratio=0.02, tau_pixels=3)
✅ Object change detected, maintaining stickiness

Top objects (comprehensive scoring):
  object_0: masked_max=0.800, regularity=1.000, contrast=1.000, 
            area_frac=0.006, border_penalty=0.000, confidence=0.122, comp_score=1.897
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior Changes**

### **Before (Global Pixel Diff Issues)**
- ❌ Any change anywhere triggered "successful" stickiness
- ❌ No contrast consideration in object selection
- ❌ Stickiness persisted indefinitely
- ❌ No CNN probability gating

### **After (Object-Scoped Stickiness)**
- ✅ **Only changes within clicked object trigger success**
- ✅ **High-contrast objects emphasized in selection**
- ✅ **Conservative stickiness with proper clearing**
- ✅ **CNN probability gating prevents false persistence**

## 🚀 **Key Classes Updated**

### `ImprovedHierarchicalHypothesisManager`
- Added `detect_object_scoped_change()` method
- Added `_calculate_boundary_contrast()` method
- Enhanced `calculate_comprehensive_object_score()` with contrast
- Improved `record_successful_click()` with object mask storage
- Added `update_stickiness()` with conservative clearing

### `ImprovedProductionReCoNArcAngel`
- Replaced global frame change detection with object-scoped
- Added object index tracking (`prev_obj_idx`)
- Enhanced statistics with stickiness metrics
- Improved debug logging with object-scoped details

## ✅ **Validation**

The improved stickiness mechanism has been validated with:
- **Unit Tests**: Object-scoped change detection, contrast calculation, conservative gating
- **Integration Tests**: Full production agent workflow
- **Parameter Tests**: All thresholds (τ_ratio, τ_pixels, K, p_min) working correctly
- **Debug Tests**: Comprehensive logging and visualization

## 🎉 **Ready for Production**

The improved object-scoped stickiness mechanism is now ready for deployment. It should completely resolve the stickiness issues described in the original problem:

- ✅ **No false positives** from changes outside clicked objects
- ✅ **High-contrast objects preferred** in selection
- ✅ **Conservative persistence** with proper clearing
- ✅ **Robust parameter tuning** with sensible defaults

**The coordinate selection should now be much more accurate and reliable.**
